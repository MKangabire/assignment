# MNIST Neural Network

This project implements a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The network is trained to recognize digits (0-9) and achieve high accuracy on both the training and test datasets.

## Features
- **Dataset**: Uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
- **Model Architecture**: A fully connected neural network with hidden layers and activation functions.
- **Training**: Implements gradient descent with backpropagation.
- **Evaluation**: Calculates accuracy and loss on both training and test sets.
